## A-B-Hypothesis-Testing:: Ad campaign performance 

### Objective of the study
Brand awareness is a key component  in business, it helps keep your brand top-of-mind with your audience by driving consumers' decisions which offers a competitive advantage. Smart AD is an advertising company that seeks to test the brand awareness by assessing the user engagement with the campaign ads in the site.

The goal in this study is to  use A/B testing and to see if the control group(with the dummy ad) has performed better than the exposed group to determine if advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.

### Methods
Smart AD’s approach to measuring the  significance of the brand awareness is by use of A/B testing statistical model.

Definition:
 A/B testing model is an experiment where audience(consumers) is split to test a number of features of the campaign that are run to determine which performs better. In this case, the goal is to ascertain between the control and the exposed group who performed better.
 
There are two different methods that are used in performing A/B testing in the study;
 
In classical A/B testing, p-values to measure the significance of the experimental feature (being exposed to an ad in our case)  over the null hypothesis (the hypothesis that there is no difference in brand awareness between the exposed and control groups in the current case)

Using Machine learning approach generates insights from complex systems by considering more than two variants that include all of the ongoing events, user features
